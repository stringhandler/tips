# TIP-0003: Tari Hidden Address Protocol (THAP)

TIP Number: 0003
Title: Tari Hidden Address Protocol

## Abstract

TBD


## Motivation

Applications can use the THAP to prove that a user has found a secret address, and indirectly prove the means that they found it. The proof itself is done by sending a transaction to 
the address. Any user with the private view key can recover outputs sent to this address and reveal them, possibly through a web
site.

For example, a user could create a Tari wallet, hide the address in a geocache and then scan the blockchain using a viewkey and host a website
of users who have found the geocache.

The assumption here is that the Tari Address never gets leaked.

Other use cases include:

| Use case | Possible implementation |
| --- | --- | 
| Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) | Users scan a hidden Tari address (QR/NFC) at an event, gallery, or location to privately record attendance without exposing their identity or wallet publicly. |
| Private Ticketing | A user generates one address per ticket. Sending a transaction to the address claims the ticket |
| Supply Chain Provenance | Each shipment or product stage has its own Tari wallet; participants send encrypted notes as private checkpoints, viewable only by authorized auditors via view keys | 
| Proof of Discovery / Exploration Games | eal-world QR or NFC tags correspond to secret Tari addresses; scanning them proves physical presence (geocache, ARGs, scavenger hunts, etc.). | 
| Educational or Training Badges | Course completions or certifications are logged as private notes to an institutional view key; students retain privacy while institutions can verify attendance or progress. | 

## Specification

No changes are required to implement this on Tari, but users who wish to implement a use case above would need to:
1. Create a private view key and spend key (usually from creating a new wallet with a seed phrase)
2. Create a Tari address (A) from the view key and a spend key. 
3. Keep all of the above secret.
4. Depending on the use case, publish A to the selective audience.
